## How to Use

NOTE: you should know how to read Chinese numbers 1-10 to test this project (you can skip to the code section if you don't)

1. clone or download this project and cd into 'Chinese-Character-Recognition' folder

2. source install.sh for mac or run the .bat on windows

3. export FLASK_APP = 'backendMain.py'

4. flask run; then open localhost:5000

5. On the home page, you input the Chinese character through the webcam. Going to /draw might be easier because then you can draw the character. 

6. View the output in the terminal!

## Code

This project was built using a handmade Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Filter3x3.py for learning purposes. If you don't know about it yet, please check out tensorflow since it has prebuilt models and might be better for your project than handmaking everything!
